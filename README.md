# ðŸŽ¨ Personal Profile Card â€“ Summer_School_Day_2

This project showcases my understanding of **HTML** and the **three types of CSS** â€” *inline, internal, and external*, along with different CSS selectors to style a unique personal profile card.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Description

I built a modern, interactive profile card to represent myself as a **Web Developer**, using various styling techniques in CSS. It demonstrates how to organize styles effectively and creatively while maintaining clean, readable code.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Applied

### ðŸ”§ CSS Types

- **Inline CSS**: Applied quick styling directly to elements (e.g., section background).
- **Internal CSS**: Used in the `<style>` block to define fonts and heading styles.
- **External CSS**: Main styles were handled in `style.css` for better structure and reusability.
